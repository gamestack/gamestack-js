Developer Notes: How to do docs:

have grunt output to the outputhtml folder.

Take html files (html only) and paste here)

*There was a problem with styles and fonts / etc.. directiories being wrong.

Luckily the html is still working.

If problem persists or becomes worse, go back to the grunt/jsdocs from before 11/2017
